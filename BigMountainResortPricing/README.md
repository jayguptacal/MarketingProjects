# Details about the Big Mountain Resort Pricing Springboard Project

## Problem Identification and Goals of this Project
The purpose of this data science project is to come up with a pricing model for ski resort tickets in our market segment. Big Mountain suspects it may not be maximizing its returns, relative to its position in the market. It also does not have a strong sense of what facilities matter most to visitors, particularly which ones they're most likely to pay more for. This project aims to build a predictive model for ticket price based on a number of facilities, or properties, boasted by resorts (at the resorts). This model will be used to provide guidance for Big Mountain's pricing and future facility investment plans.

## Jupyter Notebooks for various phases
I follow the the Data Science Method (DSM) process to do the projects. And based on the project, I decide what phases will be applicable for the project. Each phase is clearly shown in the below image:

If any notebook does not load and gives error message, please reload it. Since the notebooks are data heavy, sometimes you may have to click on the ***'reload'*** link a few times before it loads properly.
