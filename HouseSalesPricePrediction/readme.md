During the start-up phase of any company, it's hard to hire a full team of data science professionals. Imagine if the founders want an idea to be tested quickly without incurring any expenses. This is the problem faced by many data science professionals. To simulate the similar situations for a start-up real-estate company, I am building a new machine learning model predicting the house prices. The main idea is to empower the users to check their house prices and get the full report via email which will be used to connect with the users and then use that email to start building the relationship with the users.

Being a start-up, the budget is zero. Hence the main idea here is to test out the concept first and build a demo application quickly using the open-source resources and then demonstrate it to the management team to show them the power of the pilot project.

Keeping this in mind, the primary focus of this project is to predict the house prices for the given dataset using machine learning models. In order build this model, I am going to use the publicly available dataset for predicting house prices. Once the model is built, then it will be deployed as an interface for the private use for the demonstration purpose only.
